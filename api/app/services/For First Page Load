4. All Amenites
We have an amenity categories, in api its called facilities not amenities so each facility has property_group_descriptions which are groups and used to group facilities. here are a list of groups

{
  "property_group_descriptions": [
    "Access",
    "Accessibility",
    "Available in all rooms",
    "Cleanliness and safety",
    "Dining, drinking, and snacking",
    "Family",
    "For the kids",
    "Getting around",
    "Internet access",
    "Land sports",
    "Languages spoken",
    "Outdoor",
    "Services and conveniences",
    "Sports equipment rental",
    "Swimming & soaking",
    "Things to do, ways to relax"
  ]
}

To get all facilities groupd by property_group_descriptions in json format you can execute sql query

```
SELECT json_agg(
         json_build_object(
             'property_group_description', property_group_description,
             'facilities', facilities
         )
       ) AS grouped_facilities
FROM (
    SELECT property_group_description, array_agg(property_name) AS facilities
    FROM public.facilities
    WHERE hotel_id = 2937
    GROUP BY property_group_description
) subquery;
```

Output is:
